  <p>I don't know <em>how</em> I'm meant to be writing this. I'm not a writer. Ella thought keeping a blog would help but it hasn't because nothing ever happens to me. But today, something did. Something happened.</p>

<p>I was walking in the park and I bumped into Mike Stamford. We were sort of mates when we were students. We got coffee and I mentioned that I wanted to move. He said he knew of someone in a similar situation. So we went to Barts and he introduced us.</p>

<p>Except, he didn't. He didn't introduce us. The man knew who I was. Somehow he knew everything about me. He knew I'd served in Afghanistan and he knew I'd been invalided. He said my wound was psychosomatic so he didn't get everything right but he even knew why I was there, despite the fact that Mike hadn't told him.</p>

<p>I googled him when I got back to the flat and found a link to his website <a href="http://www.thescienceofdeduction.co.uk/">The Science of Deduction</a>.</p>

<p>It's mad. I think he might be mad. He was certainly arrogant and really quite rude and he looks about 12 and he's clearly a bit public school and, yes, I definitely think he might be mad but he was also strangely likeable. He was charming. It really was all just a bit strange.</p>

<p>So tomorrow, we're off to look at a flat. Me and the madman. Me and Sherlock Holmes.</p>
